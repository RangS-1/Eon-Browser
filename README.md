# Eon Browser V.0.3
This is Eon Browser, it was maded with PyQt5WebEngine. Eon Browser is a very lightweight browser, even for your old pc (if you have, or maybe only me that have an old pc -_-'). I made this browser to google dorking, why? because there's no history, no cookies, no web account and using an old google . it's incognito than incognito itself.

- compatible with python3
- compatible with old pc
